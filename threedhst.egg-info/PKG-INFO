        This now takes precedence over the frozen google-code SVN repository.
        
        Note that much of the grism analysis code including the aXe wrappers is now deprecated in favor of the "interlacing" code described by Momcheva et al. (http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.02106).  That pipeline will be made available shortly.
